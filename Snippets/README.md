# Snippets

These are shared Xcode snippets of useful reusable code. They allow us to quickly write common code and patterns.

## Installation

First, install the gem `gem install xcodesnippet`

Then install the snippet you want with:

```
xcodesnippet install path/to/file
```

Restart Xcode and you should see your snippet.

## Manual Installation

In Xcode 7, open a workspace and toggle the right sidebar to be visible. On the bottom, there is a panel with four icons in the header. Click on the `{ }` icon to open the Code Snippets Library.

Now copy-paste the code from one of these snippets, highlight the code block you just pasted and drag it to the Code Snippet panel. Make sure to match the suggested platform, language, and completion scope. The completion shortcut corresponds to the filename of the code snippet.
