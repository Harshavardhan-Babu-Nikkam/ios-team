# Common iOS Infrastructure

Motivation: standardizing things that provide no unique value to an application focuses our time on providing the unique value each application has, giving us a competitive edge in the market. Some choices are made not for convenience of the developers of the app themselves, but to reduce the pain or communication burden of others who care about our products.

Items listed here include tools, libraries, conventions, and processes.

### Document Status

This is currently just a brain dump of everything I can think of. Over time we'll actually discuss and solidify each item, and things will start to take shape.


# Required

These items are required for each project we publish. Exceptions must be approved by the larger iOS team after a rousing debate of the merits and aims of removing the item.


## SwiftyBeaver â€”Â Logging

[SwiftyBeaver](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver): Convenient logging during development & release in Swift 2 & 3 https://swiftybeaver.com

_It's awesome because:_

You can see logs from real users in near real-time. Searching and grouping are also great. The SDK is really lightweight and easy to use.

<img src="images/swiftybeaver-console.png" width="600" alt="SwiftyBeaver Mac console app">

_Tips & Conventions:_

1. Use consistent `Event` names.
1. Set the user identifier (see `registerUser` below), so it'll be shown in each log line.
1. Don't use a cloud destination during testing.

    ```swift
    struct SwiftyBeaverConfig {

        static fileprivate let console = ConsoleDestination()
        static fileprivate let cloud = SBPlatformDestination(...)

        static func setupLogging(testing: Bool = false) {
            log.addDestination(console)
            if !testing {
                log.addDestination(cloud)
            }
        }

        static func registerUser(_ email: String) {
            cloud.analyticsUserName = email
        }

    }
    ```

1. Use middleware to log `Command`s and `Event`s according to severity.

    ```swift
    func process(event: Event, state: State) {
        switch event {
        case _ as SeriousErrorEvent:
            log.error("event=\(event)")
        case _ as MinorErrorEvent, _ as SharedPasswordError:
            log.warning("event=\(event)")
        case _ as NotableEvent:
            log.info("event=\(event)")
        case _ as AuthenticationAction, _ as DataAction, _ as ViewAction:
            log.debug("event=\(event)")
        default:
            log.verbose("event=\(event)")
        }
    }
    ```

## Marshal â€” JSON Parsing

[Marshal](https://github.com/utahiosmac/Marshal/): Marshaling the typeless wild west of [String: Any]

_It's awesome because:_

It's fast, type-safe, Swift-y, and great. It even lets us pull in `Date`, `URL`, `enum` and other great stuff.

_Tips & Conventions:_

1. Use the `value(for:)` function rather than the `<|` operator as much as possible for readability.

    ```swift
    init(object: MarshaledObject) throws {
        nominator = try object.value(for: "nominator")
        connected = try object.value(for: Keys.connected)
    }
    ```

1. Define `enum`s with `RawRepresentable` values for great parsing from JSON. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "teamMemberId": "axF87b",
      "noteType": 0,
      "text": "First, we should play foosball."
    }
    ```

    ```swift
    enum NoteType: Int {
        case agenda
        case summary
    }

    struct TeamMemberNote: Unmarshaling {
        var teamMemberId: String
        var noteType: NoteType
        var text: String

        init(object: MarshaledObject) throws {
            teamMemberId = try object <| "teamMemberId"
            noteType = try object <| "noteType"
            text = try object <| "text"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Parse objects using composite keys when intermediate objects aren't valuable. For example:

    ```swift
    approval.note = try detailedObject <| "approvalAction.input.noteFromApprover.note"
    ```

_People it helps:_

* iOS devs

_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* Plain `[String:Any]` manipulation
* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)


## Reactor â€” Manage app data flow

[Reactor](https://github.com/ReactorSwift/Reactor): ðŸ”„ Unidirectional data flow in Swift.

_It's awesome because:_

It's crazy-simple. It's reactish. It separates `Command`s from `Event`s. It's got `Middleware`.

_Tips & Conventions:_

1. Use separate files for each `State`, `Command`, or `Event` object. Place these into file system folders and Xcode group folders named `States`, `Commands`, `Events`.

    <img src="images/reactor-xcode.png" width="197px" alt="Xcode Project navigator with groups for States, Commands, Events.">

1. Make all your `State` and `Event` objects implement `JSONMarshaling`. This is great for emailing support details when errors occur, and improving your own debugging.

    ```swift
    extension AppState: JSONMarshaling {
        func jsonObject() -> JSONObject {
            // details go here...
        }
    }
    ```

    ```swift
    func emailSupport() {
        let email = MFMailComposeViewController()
        email.setSubject("Need support")
        email.setMessageBody(messageText, isHTML: false)
        let json = state.recentActions.jsonObject()
        if let data = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: json, options: [.prettyPrinted]) {
            email.addAttachmentData(data, mimeType: "json", fileName: "recent-actions.json")
        }
    }
    ```

_People it helps:_

* iOS devs

_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* [ReSwift]()
* Standard MVC "pass data via `prepare(for segue:, sender:)`"


## XCTest â€”Â Unit and UI Testing

## ios-network-stack â€”Â Internal HTTP API calls

## Kingfisher â€” Image loading & caching

[Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher): A lightweight, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web.

_It's awesome because:_

It's so forgettable, because it's fast and just works. When you need more power, it's got you covered.

_Tips & Conventions:_

1. Use it when setting images on your table or collection view cells.

    ```swift
    eventImageView.kf.setImage(with: imageURL)
    ```

1. Use it to prefetch images that you know will be coming up soon.

    ```swift
    // MARK: - Tableview Prefetching
    extension ChallengePhotoFeedViewController: UITableViewDataSourcePrefetching {
        func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, prefetchRowsAt indexPaths: [IndexPath]) {
            let indices = indexPaths.map { $0.row }
            let entries = indices.flatMap { photoEntries[$0] }
            ImagePrefetcher(urls: entries.flatMap { $0.photoURL }).start()
        }
    }
    ```

1. Use advanced features to do stuff like create template images.

    ```swift
    iconImageView.kf.setImage(with: interest.iconURL, placeholder: nil, options: nil) { image, error, cacheType, imageURL in
        guard let image = image else { return }
        self.iconImageView.image = image.withRenderingMode(.alwaysTemplate)
    }
    ```

_People it helps:_

* Users (because images are fast with caching)
* iOS devs
* API devs (because they don't need to make special APIs to help us cache well)

_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* Plain `URLRequest()` and friends
* [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage)
