# Common iOS Patterns

### Motivation

Doing standard things in the same way each time makes it easy to ignore the mundane parts of them, to recognize quickly what's going on, and to later update every instance of its use throughout the app when we change how we want it done.

### Document Status

The list of items, grouping, and ordering of them is done. We're now working through to write up each item.

# Required

These things _must_ be done the same way across every project in order to pass a code review.

## Compatible Versioning: major.minor only

Use [Compatible Versioning](https://github.com/staltz/comver) (ComVer) instead of Semantic Versioning (SemVer), for both app marketing and library release version numbers.

_It's awesome because:_

It simplifies versioning down to, "Is this version backwards compatible or not?" and makes nicer looking marketing version numbers for users.

It also takes the guesswork out of deciding on a marketing version.

_How it works:_

Increment the MAJOR version when you make backwards-incompatible updates of any kind MINOR version when you make 100% backwards-compatible updates

_Tips & Conventions:_

* Continue to add a build number to the marketing number for the app, making this number use 3 segments instead of 4.
* Continue to tag each release of a library with `major.minor.0` to satisfy current Swift Package Manager behavior (Jan 2017) which requires full SemVer tags. This is 100% semantically equivalent to ComVer.

_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* [SemVer](http://semver.org)

## App root view controller

## Device Registration

On each app launch attempt to get a push notification token. This doesn't request permissions to alert a user of anything; requesting permission for badges, notifications, and sounds is another pattern.

_It's awesome because:_

You're able to silently communicate with your app, even if you've never asked the user for permission to show alerts. Later, when you're ready to add user-visible alerts, it's just a simple matter of deciding how to present that permission requestâ€”the plumbing to make it work is already in place.

_How it works:_

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    return true
}
```

When you get the token, format it.

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    let formatted = deviceToken.reduce("", {$0 + String(format: "%02X", $1)})
}
```

Then create the following JSON to send to the push notification server. Note that if getting a token fails, you should still send the payload with a `nil` token. Also `lat` and `lng` would require you to have location permissions. Use something like [DeviceInfo](https://github.com/benjaminsnorris/DeviceInfo) to get all the information properly formatted.

```json
{
  "name" : "John's iPhone ðŸ˜‚",
  "locale": {
    "translation" : "en",
    "language" : "en",
    "identifier" : "en_US",
  },
  "location" : {
    "lat" : 40.7608,
    "lng" : -111.891,
    "timezone" : "America\/Denver",
  },
  "hardware" : {
    "name" : "iPhone 6S Plus",
    "version" : "iPhone8,2",
    "type" : "iPhone",
    "identifier" : "54995F65-CE13-449D-84F0-A74C51F9FB07"
  },
  "OS" : {
    "name" : "iOS",
    "version" : "10.1"
  },
  "notification_settings" : {
    "lockScreen" : "enabled",
    "alert" : "enabled",
    "alertStyle" : "banner",
    "badge" : "enabled",
    "notificationCenter" : "enabled",
    "sound" : "enabled",
    "carPlay" : "notSupported",
    "authorization" : "authorized"
  },
  "app" : {
    "name" : "Great Work",
    "version" : "2.5.2",
    "build" : "2.5.2.1674",
    "identifier" : "com.octanner.gw",
    "token" : "F702DDF80B4BD3622F8CCAEEB77657FE18AB8B71C8563622B2D9088C0BEF3383",
  },
  "screen_metrics" : {
    "density" : 3,
    "h" : 2208,
    "w" : 1242
  }
}
```

**Rationale for the details:**

- Device name: this can be shown to the user when allowing them to manage approved devices for their account.
- Locale: Which languages do our customer use on their device? Should we support a language we currently don't?
- Location: Timezone is used to send user-visible notifications at the optimum time they are likely to read them.
- Hardware: Can we use 3D Touch? Can we end support for the iPhone 4S?
- OS: How quick are our customers upgrading?
- Notification Settings: Should we even attempt to send this user-visible notification to this device?
- App: How quickly are our users updating our app? When the server wants to send a notification to Great Work, it shouldn't use the token for Welbe.
- Token: Allow server-to-app communication as necessary, without bothering the user, for scenarios like image caching with Kingfisher before the user even opens the app.
- Screen Metrics: What resolution assets should our APIs prepare?

**Note**

Also make sure your project has push settings turned on for background notifications so that you'll (almost) always get a push token.

_Tips & Conventions:_

1. Don't forget the part about the background settings for your project.
1. Only add `lat` and `lng` if you're actually using location for something user-visible, and you've requested and received permission.

## Naming and defining colors

_It's awesome because:_

You know exactly where to go to change any built-in color used by your app. This doesn't apply to dynamic colors used based on API values.

_How it works:_

Define all common colors used in your app inside a `UIColor` extension in a file called `UIColor+MyApp.swift`. Use color literals over hex initializers, etc., as it is much easier for developer brains to interpret. To add a color literal start typing `#color` in Xcode and autocomplete should help you out.

<img src="images/ColorExample.png" width="491px" alt="Code for a UIColor extension using color literals">

_Tips & Conventions:_

_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* `UIColor(hex: 0xabcdef)`
* Color definitions all over the code.

## Fonts

### Handle font accessibility sizing

## Extract Xcode Build Phases into Separate Scripts

_It's awesome because:_

Xcode project files store scripts as one long line, making diffing impossible, syntax highlighting is non-existant, and the change history is muddled with the project edits. This pattern brings all those back.

_How it works:_

Extract all Build Phase logic out of the Xcode text box for that phase and into a separate script file that is simply invoked from the build phase. We've selected most of the advice from Giovanni Lodi's article, [Better Xcode Run Script Build Phases](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/better-build-phase-scripts).

Make the scripts smart enough to check for the tools they require, and to report errors when they fail. Add `set -x` to ensure the scripts echo all the commands they run.

Report errors:

```sh
echo "error: Your error message"
echo "warning: Your warning message"
```

Check for tools:

```sh
if ! which <your tool> > /dev/null; then
  echo "error: <your tool> is missing"
  exit 1
fi
```

_Tips & Conventions:_

* Place scripts in the `<appName>/scripts/` directory of the repo.
* Name the Build Phase to describe what the script will do.

_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* Script contents coded into the Xcode project file

## Empty states with UITableView

Use [secondary views](https://blog.curtisherbert.com/secondary-views/) in storyboards to build out your empty state views.

_It's awesome because_

You can build the empty state view out in storyboards separately from your viewController to keep your ViewController looking clean. It's also really easy to add and remove the view from the tableview when needed.

_How it works_

1. In storyboards, drop a `UIView` into the `ToolBar` or your ViewController. The same as if you were adding an NSObject to the ViewController to create a UITableViewDataSource

1. Create your view how you'd like it to appear, adding views and labels and even buttons.

    <img src="images/emptystate.png" width="412px" alt="Xcode storyboard showing secondary views.">

1. Then create an outlet to your secondary view in your ViewController.

    ```swift
   Â @IBOutlet var emptyStateView: UIView!
    ```

1. To show the empty state view just add that view as the `backgroundView` of the tableView when the tableView is empty.

    ```swift
    tableView.backgroundView = emptyStateView
    ```

1. To remove the view, just set the `backgroundView` to nil

    ```swift
    tableView.backgroudView = nil
    ```

_Tips & Conventions:_

 * Make sure the outlet is `strong` instead of `weak` because we're possibly removing these views after we show them. If we remove a weak view from the main screen then nothing is left holding onto the view, so the IBOutlet would turn nil and we'd never be able to re-show it


_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* Hiding the tableView and showing a different view on top or underneath.

## Keyboard handling

## Safely test network and configurations

_It's awesome because:_

You can safely configure any part of your app, because these values can't ever be set on user devices.

_How it works:_

1. Set the desired environment variables in your scheme's Run configuration. You find them under the Arguments tab.

    <img src="images/process-info-env-vars.png" width="867px" alt="Xcode scheme Run phase arguments tab">

1. Hide environment variable access behind a `ProcessInfo` extension. Combine this with the `Keys.pattern` below. Create calculated variables for common access patterns.

    ```swift
    extension ProcessInfo {

        static var hideUI: Bool {
            return ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["hideUI"] == "YES"
        }

        static var network: String? {
            return ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment[Keys.network]
        }

        static var isTakingSnapshots: Bool {
            return ProcessInfo.network == Keys.snapshots
        }

    }
    ```

1. _Judiciously_ use them to customize the app's behavior for testing scenarios.

    ```swift
    @UIApplicationMain class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

        func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
            if let network = ProcessInfo.network, token = ProcessInfo.token {
                MyAPI().authenticate(with: token)
            }
            return true
        }

    }
    ```

1. Setup the values in your UI tests in `setUp` before you launch the app.

    ```swift
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        setupSnapshot(app)

        app.launchEnvironment["network"] = "snapshots"
        app.launchEnvironment["token"] = "0c8268b219aa28b31fde48e40c4aca8"
        app.launch()
    }
    ```

_Tips & Conventions:_

* We much prefer environment variables over launch arguments. Launch arguments can be accessed via `UserDefaults`, which creates the (remote) possibility that this debug behavior may be triggered on user devices.
* Because this behavior can't be triggered on user devices, we don't protect the places that use it with `#if DEBUG` unless they use some private API that can't ship to the App Store.

_Alternatives we don't want to use:_

* Launch arguments
* Settings.app settings
* In-App debug settings UI
